piarocio2013 (2012-02-07) @yuchunsa it's because ELISA tests can provide qualitative results, indicating whether a patient is positive or negative for the presence of the antigen or antibody, or an ELISA can provide quantitative results, determining how much of the detected substance is present. So If the ELISA test can still detect disease antigen or antibody at the smallest dilution and smallest﻿ final concentration, then the patient must have a very strong infection.;

more wells is to get more repetition for better significant results, imagine each well as a single little experiment, and dilutions help us know the different fluorescence at different dilution levels.;

Israeli6761 (2011-11-21) I assume the test must be done quickly otherwise given enough﻿ time, the well with the more enzyme will run out of substrate and in the well with even the smallest amount of enzyme will continue catalyzing substrates and will catch up to the well with the higher amount of subrstrates;

OxAxS (2011-04-26) @snowman3475 Sometimes the color is not so clear and therefore you'll need to use that﻿ device. The fluid you see is serum. This test is used to check if you have antibodies against the antigen in your blood.

GDQT (2011-06-13) so EIA is very similar to ELISA, the only different is﻿ that ELisa is start with Ag while EIA start with Ab. both using enzyme bind Ab to detect. the enzyme is specific for a substrate that after be catalysis, the substrate will absorb light and reveal color. Is that right?;

Mental State Examination (MSE) is a structured way of observing and describing a patientapos;s current state of mind, under the domains of appearance, attitude, behavior, mood and affect, speech, thought process, thought content, perception, cognition, insight and judgement. There are some minor variations in the subdivision of the MSE and the sequence and names of MSE domains. The purpose of the MSE is to obtain a comprehensive cross-sectional description of the patientapos;s mental state, which when combined with the biographical and historical information of the psychiatric history, allows the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis and formulation, which are required for coherent treatment planning. The data are collected through a combination of direct and indirect means: unstructured observation while obtaining the biographical and social information, focused questions about current symptoms, and formalised psychological tests.

It is currently considered to be one of the neglected tropical diseases; less common than tuberculosis but more common than leprosy. The initial lesion is a painless subcutaneous nodule, usually less than 5 cm diameter and adherent to skin. The nodule typically breaks down centrally after days to weeks forming an ulcer with undermined edges. Thus, the external appearance of the ulcer underestimates the true size of the affected area. The patient remains well and there is no pain unless secondary bacterial infection occurs. Other forms of M. ulcerans disease include a firm plaque lesions that behaves in the same way as the nodule or an oedematous lesion that is more aggressive and extends rapidly resulting in a very large ulcer. Any age group can be affected by Buruli ulcer diseases, but the incidence peaks at 5 to 15 years. Ulcers are most frequently on the limbs but can be on the trunk or head, sometimes with catastrophic consequences such as loss of sight or loss of breast or genital tissue. Healing close to a joint can result in contracture, and sometimes there is so much tissue destruction on a limb that amputation is unavoidable. Occasionally osteomyelitis occurs in bone adjacent to a skin lesion but involvement of other organs is rare. Disseminated disease with HIV has been reported.",,
